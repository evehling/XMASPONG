# PONG
A Pong starter game for Dad's Arduboy (Christmas present). Used an arcade font generator, put the images to monchrome, then converted them to bitmaps using http://fuopy.github.io/arduboy-image-converter/. 
# To Download and Play @Dad:
  1) Download Arduino IDE
  2) Download my XMASPONG.ino file
  3) Configure port and device settings in IDE
  4) Turn on Arduboy and upload!
